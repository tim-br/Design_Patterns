I want to read as much as I can about design patterns and I'm collecting everything I find and implementing them in a few languages.

Since I'm currently learning Javascript, most of the examples are in javascript, many of them coming from the book by Addy Osmani, Learning Javascript Design Patterns.

In the future I'd like to read the gang of 4 book, the Java Head First book on Design patterns and look at design patterns in Lisp and Python, and perhaps in something like python.

I would also like to build some kind of logo copycat in meteor on which users can apply design patterns.
